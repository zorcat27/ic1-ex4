Based on this information in the exercise, I have learned about the various git commands that will allow me to create new repositories, commit changes, verify changes with diff, branch when trying something new, and making it easier to 
share my working code with others.

The videos and exercises have been very helpful and I feel confident in being 
able to use git for the class homeworks and future projects.
